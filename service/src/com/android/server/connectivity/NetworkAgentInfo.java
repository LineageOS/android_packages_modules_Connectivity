// States of a network:
// --------------------
// 1. registered, uncreated, disconnected, unvalidated
//    This state is entered when a NetworkFactory registers a NetworkAgent in any state except
//    the CONNECTED state.
// 2. registered, uncreated, connecting, unvalidated
//    This state is entered when a registered NetworkAgent for a VPN network transitions to the
//    CONNECTING state (TODO: go through this state for every network, not just VPNs).
//    ConnectivityService will tell netd to create the network early in order to add extra UID
//    routing rules referencing the netID. These rules need to be in place before the network is
//    connected to avoid racing against client apps trying to connect to a half-setup network.
// 3. registered, uncreated, connected, unvalidated
//    This state is entered when a registered NetworkAgent transitions to the CONNECTED state.
//    ConnectivityService will tell netd to create the network if it was not already created, and
//    immediately transition to state #4.
// 4. registered, created, connected, unvalidated
//    If this network can satisfy the default NetworkRequest, then NetworkMonitor will
//    probe for Internet connectivity.
//    If this network cannot satisfy the default NetworkRequest, it will immediately be
//    transitioned to state #5.
//    A network may remain in this state if NetworkMonitor fails to find Internet connectivity,
//    for example:
//    a. a captive portal is present, or
//    b. a WiFi router whose Internet backhaul is down, or
//    c. a wireless connection stops transferring packets temporarily (e.g. device is in elevator
//       or tunnel) but does not disconnect from the AP/cell tower, or
//    d. a stand-alone device offering a WiFi AP without an uplink for configuration purposes.
// 5. registered, created, connected, validated
// 6. registered, created, connected, (validated or unvalidated), destroyed
//    This is an optional state where the underlying native network is destroyed but the network is
//    still connected for scoring purposes, so can satisfy requests, including the default request.
//    It is used when the transport layer wants to replace a network with another network (e.g.,
//    when Wi-Fi has roamed to a different BSSID that is part of a different L3 network) and does
//    not want the device to switch to another network until the replacement connects and validates.
//
// The device's default network connection:
// ----------------------------------------
// Networks in states #4 and #5 may be used as a device's default network connection if they
// satisfy the default NetworkRequest.
// A network, that satisfies the default NetworkRequest, in state #5 should always be chosen
// in favor of a network, that satisfies the default NetworkRequest, in state #4.
// When deciding between two networks, that both satisfy the default NetworkRequest, to select
// for the default network connection, the one with the higher score should be chosen.
//
// When a network disconnects:
// ---------------------------
// If a network's transport disappears, for example:
// a. WiFi turned off, or
// b. cellular data turned off, or
// c. airplane mode is turned on, or
// d. a wireless connection disconnects from AP/cell tower entirely (e.g. device is out of range
//    of AP for an extended period of time, or switches to another AP without roaming)
// then that network can transition from any state (#1-#5) to unregistered.  This happens by
// the transport disconnecting their NetworkAgent's AsyncChannel with ConnectivityManager.
// ConnectivityService also tells netd to destroy the network.
//
// When ConnectivityService disconnects a network:
// -----------------------------------------------
// If a network is just connected, ConnectivityService will think it will be used soon, but might
// not be used. Thus, a 5s timer will be held to prevent the network being torn down immediately.
// This "nascent" state is implemented by the "lingering" logic below without relating to any
// request, and is used in some cases where network requests race with network establishment. The
// nascent state ends when the 5-second timer fires, or as soon as the network satisfies a
// request, whichever is earlier. In this state, the network is considered in the background.
//
// If a network has no chance of satisfying any requests (even if it were to become validated
// and enter state #5), ConnectivityService will disconnect the NetworkAgent's AsyncChannel.
//
// If the network was satisfying a foreground NetworkRequest (i.e. had been the highest scoring that
// satisfied the NetworkRequest's constraints), but is no longer the highest scoring network for any
// foreground NetworkRequest, then there will be a 30s pause to allow network communication to be
// wrapped up rather than abruptly terminated. During this pause the network is said to be
// "lingering". During this pause if the network begins satisfying a foreground NetworkRequest,
// ConnectivityService will cancel the future disconnection of the NetworkAgent's AsyncChannel, and
// the network is no longer considered "lingering". After the linger timer expires, if the network
// is satisfying one or more background NetworkRequests it is kept up in the background. If it is
// not, ConnectivityService disconnects the NetworkAgent's AsyncChannel.
